# Dev Meeting Topics on SwiftUI

At Small Planet we have a weekly dev meeting. A developer on the team will routinely create and share a short presentation,
aka Dev Meeting Topics. This repository contains one presentation so far on SwiftUI (although was optimistically given
a plural name).

## Presentation 1: SwiftUI Under the Hood: Layout and Updates

The presentation is provided as a macos app (open Contemplate.xcodeproj under folder Presentation 1")

The individual slides for this presentation are provided in a PDF (SwiftUI Presentation 1.pdf)
